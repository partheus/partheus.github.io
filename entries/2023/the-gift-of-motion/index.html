  <article class="irevamp-mx-auto" id="article">
    <p>In the summer of 2022 , mostly by virtue of a generally efficient and lazy disposition, I had purchased a simple commuter bike
from a person off Facebook Marketplace. It was a simple, five-speed bike with a kickstand. It was amazing, but
I could not ride it for longer distances, but it did the job just fine, so I didn't think much of it.</p>
<p>Over time, as it began to dawn on me that I wasn't really riding this bike for longer distances, I began to think about
things. Much earlier this year, I logged back in to my Craigslist account.</p>
<p>I had a few things in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bike that could handle longer distances</li>
<li>Better suspension</li>
<li>Cheaper than a brand new bike</li>
</ul>
<p>Craigslist is a whole another ballgame compared to Facebook Marketplace. It oozes a certain energy, a sort of hideous charm and all that.</p>
<p>Anyway, I saw this anonymous post about a <strong>&quot;like-new&quot;</strong> mountain bike, year old, &lt;$100, and one photo.</p>
<p><em>What the hell</em>, I thought, <em>and why the hell not</em>. So I emailed the person, and they responded back via email.</p>
<p>I set up a time to meet the man near his building complex, and arrived to the place and sent him a heads-up email.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to me, the man had also posted his phone number in the Craigslist posting.
I had missed this part completely.</p>
<p>After about 10 minutes of waiting I decided to glance at the Craigslist posting again,
lo and behold, with a phone number in plain sight. I called him immediately and listened to a sleepy voice let me know he would be down in 5.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let the record show that 1. the unusual aura that I sometimes emanate is an involuntary phenomenon witnessed more easily by people I am close to, and 2. I was wearing my normal outdoor clothes. Normal outfit.</p>
<p>When the sun had just started crouching near the skyline, the gates opened and a strange and slightly wrinkly man walked out, rolling forth a mountain bike.</p>
<p>The bike looked fine, minimal wear and tear, a bit low on air in the tires, but really without any major flags.
What was more interesting is the way this old man - in a black sweater and a long, bushy white beard and mustache - was squinting at me, but not unkindly. It reminded me of one of those scenes in Star Wars or Lord of the Rings where the protagonists interact with a mysterious bearded figure.
I wondered what kind of things this person had seen in his lifetime. What kind of people had let him pick their brain, maybe? What was up with the squinting?</p>
<p>Alright. Visages and mysteries aside, I asked him if I could take it for a spin, and he said sure, and I did, and it was fine, and I said I'd take it.</p>
<p>Here's the best part. When it was the moment of the transaction, he gripped my palm in a generally firm handshake and said &quot;Have the bike. It's yours.&quot;
Note that I had not yet paid him. I was a bit taken aback, but I said &quot;Thank you&quot; and he said &quot;You're welcome&quot; and I said &quot;I'll pay you&quot; and he said &quot;Take the bike.&quot;</p>
<p>So I blinked again and said, would you at least take this $[redacted]?</p>
<p>With barely a glance at it, he said, &quot;Sure&quot;, and then, suddenly, a sturdy bike lock had materialized in his hand, and he said &quot;Here, take this too.&quot;</p>
<p>Before the day was over, I would have serviced the bike for the road and emailed the man my sincere thanks for such a wonderful gift, to which his only response was to ride with caution.</p>
<p>Even as I was clipping the lock to my new bike(?) he looked me once over again and grinned. &quot;Thanks,&quot; I said, and he nodded.</p>
<p>Then he turned around and walked back into the building, and I never once saw him again, and the bike has been delightful company since. And now, I'm going to write poetry, if I haven't unknowingly been doing it already.</p>
