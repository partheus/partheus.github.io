- # Development

This website was engineered on a Dell G5 gaming laptop (red motif) and MacBook Pro laptop (pink motif). It is written in HTML, Markdown, Nunjucks, CSS, and JavaScript.

[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) is used for static page generation. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is used for version control. [Github](https://github.com) is used to store the repository. 

It is being tested on Cloudflare and hosted on Github Pages. See mirrors below.

I used [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) and [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) for development; [Chromium Nightly](https://www.chromium.org/Home/) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) were used for testing.

- # Design

<div class="display-columns display-columns--two display-columns__close-gap">

<div class="mb-xxs">
<p>Original wireframes / prototypes were developed using <a href="https://penpot.app/" title="Penpot" target="_blank">Penpot</a>. I like to look at things normally and at my own pace, and hence I designed the site in more or less a simplistic manner.</p> 

<p>Site icon is my own design; browser-compatible favicons were generated using <a href="https://realfavicongenerator.net/" title="realfavicongenerator website" target="_blank">realfavicongenerator</a>.</p>

{% include "../_includes/components/themeSwatch.njk" %}

Clipart and SVGs are from [OpenClipart](https://openclipart.org/). Mockups generated using [https://screenshot.rocks/](https://screenshot.rocks/).

Font faces are [Besley](https://indestructibletype.com/Besley.html) and [EB Garamond](https://github.com/octaviopardo/EBGaramond12/tree/master). The footer icons are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).


- # Privacy

The site uses JavaScript for little functional fixes, like the time-to-read text on articles; the chunkier scripts are used for the [reading](/reading) page. The reading page pulls data from my Goodreads profile, hence the singular cookie on that page.

The Currently Playing song isn't automatic. I update the data source JSON files every week or so, manually.

> This site works without JavaScript. There are no trackers of any sort.

- # Mirrors

The site is mirrored on [Cloudflare](https://partheus-github-io.pages.dev) and [Netlify](https://temporalharmonygarden.netlify.app/).

> Contact me for issues or clues on lost Inca gold or blueprints to the original [redacted] or mostly anything at all, ever. [Say hi](/hello).

This page was built using the `base` layout I made. Most pages on this site use the same `base` layout, which makes pages load faster. Read more about [static site generation](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/static-site-generator/).
