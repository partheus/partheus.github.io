- # Development

This website was engineered on a Dell G5 gaming laptop (red motif) and MacBook Pro laptop (pink motif). It is written in HTML, Markdown, Nunjucks, CSS, and Javascript.

[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) is used for static page generation. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is used for version control. [Github](https://github.com) is used to store the repository. It is being tested and hosted on CloudFlare and Netlify.

I used [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) for development; [Chromium Nightly](https://www.chromium.org/Home/) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) were used for testing.

- # Design

Original wireframes / prototypes were developed using [Lunacy](https://icons8.com/lunacy). Site icon is my own design; browser-compatible favicons were generated using [this site](https://realfavicongenerator.net/).

Clipart and SVGs are from [OpenClipart](https://openclipart.org/).

Mockups generated using [https://screenshot.rocks/](https://screenshot.rocks/).

Font faces are [Besley](https://indestructibletype.com/Besley.html) and [EB Garamond](https://github.com/octaviopardo/EBGaramond12/tree/master).

This page was built using the `base` layout I made. Most pages on this site use the same `base` layout, which makes pages load faster. Read more about [static site generation](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/static-site-generator/).
