- # Development

This website was engineered on a Dell G5 gaming laptop (red motif) and MacBook Pro laptop (pink motif). It is written in HTML, Markdown, Nunjucks, CSS, and JavaScript.

[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) is used for static page generation. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is used for version control. [Github](https://github.com) is used to store the repository. 

It is being tested on Cloudflare and hosted on Github Pages. See mirrors below.

I used [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) and [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) for development; [Chromium Nightly](https://www.chromium.org/Home/) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) were used for testing.

- # Design

Original wireframes / prototypes were developed using [Lunacy](https://icons8.com/lunacy). I like to look at things normally and at my own pace, and hence I designed the site in more or less a simplistic manner. 

Site icon is my own design; browser-compatible favicons were generated using [this site](https://realfavicongenerator.net/).

Clipart and SVGs are from [OpenClipart](https://openclipart.org/).

Mockups generated using [https://screenshot.rocks/](https://screenshot.rocks/).

Font faces are [Besley](https://indestructibletype.com/Besley.html) and [EB Garamond](https://github.com/octaviopardo/EBGaramond12/tree/master).

The footer icons are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

- # Privacy

The site uses JavaScript for little functional fixes, like the time-to-read text on articles; the chunkier scripts are used for the [reading](/reading) page. The reading page pulls data from my Goodreads profile, hence the singular cookie on that page.

The Currently Playing song isn't automatic. I update the data source JSON files every week or so, manually.

This page was built using the `base` layout I made. Most pages on this site use the same `base` layout, which makes pages load faster. Read more about [static site generation](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/static-site-generator/).
