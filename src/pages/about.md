<div class="irevamp-h5 irevamp-mt-sm bold600">Hi!</div>

I'm a web developer, documentation specialist, business analyst, a few other adjectives and roles, close confidante of the Round Table knights, <a href="/breathe" class="nolink">freelance worldsaver</a>, lentil enthusiast...

I have been designing and engineering UI solutions for over half a decade now, and received my Master's degree in 2021. Every year or so since 2017, my domain `parth.ninja` points to a fresh redesign of this personal website. Currently, [this online project](/colophon) acts as a portfolio / journal for my unusually frequent adventures, and helps me practice web development.

<!-- View [more about this site](/colophon). -->

I'm rather partial to audiobooks, as evidenced by my [weekly checkouts](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/60162168-parth-shiralkar?shelf=audiobook) at the local libraries. I live in Portland, OR, and work with a wonderful design studio as a frontend developer. View my [code, work](/code).
