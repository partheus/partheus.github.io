My journey with music began when my parents enrolled me in a vocal class at an unusually young age.

As luck would have it, even with my proclivity for immense vocal talent, in my twenties, I lean more into the instrumental areas of music production. Original soundtracks for videogames like Hotline Miami and Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number caught my fancy, and I began to create synthwave and vaporwave music.

Then I found out about artists like Playboi Carti and his specific subgenre of trap music. Not to say that his stuff isn't vocals-heavy, but the whole point of his music is that it sounds good (to some people), and not necessarily entirely legible to the human ear. That's fine. So I started making trap music.

Then it turned out that the soft music that always played in the back of my mind since I was a child was actually really, really similar to jazz. I simply had to listen to the classics. So I had a long jazz phase that is still ongoing, and now actual jazz plays in my mind if I have the right food beforehand.

These days all I listen to is George Benson and Lil Hero and Boofpaxkmooky.
