I first started using Netlify in 2018 after its free hosting offer at the time. Then I realized I was deploying way too many builds on a daily basis to sustain this lifestyle.

1. Stop builds on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
2. Push repo to `username.github.io` using [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/) and reconfigure DNS with your provider
3. ???
4. Profit

As of March 20, this website exists on GitHub's own servers.
