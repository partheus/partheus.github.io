Climbing with my friends is tricky sometimes because they're usually working on V6/V7 problems and I'm trying to send a good V5 here and there. 

The yellow V4 starts out super low and requires a little shimmying to get to move #2; after that, you need to switch feet and then make slow, calculated reaches up and around till you can get your hands matched on a stable jug hold. Problem with these previous holds is that they are either:
1. Slopers
2. Crimps

I have been able to befriend neither type of hold. Regardless, I managed to get it in the first go.
