- Back in the bouldering game regularly; starting again from v3s, but we are back ⬆⬆⬆; new [post](/climbing/) soon maybe?
- Changed one of the secondary colors on this site to a calmer yellow from a distinctly harsher green
- I cannot believe how much I've missed bouldering
- Friendsgiving is fun!
- I think I need to redo the tag engine on this blog
- While walking in the rain I found this scene that looked directly out of the I.G.I. games (maybe I.G.I. 2: Covert Strike)
