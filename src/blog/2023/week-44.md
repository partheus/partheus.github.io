- Bit of a rough week, perfectly normal
- Got a bit of a deal on some powdered cumin at Grocery Outlet, which means more Indian recipes will be cooked this fall
- Daylight Savings is starting in Oregon, but I am on Indian time for the next few days
- Diwali is next week, which means [the crown prince comes back home around this time for the coronation and celebration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana). Fitting.
- Jetlag!!!!!!!!!
