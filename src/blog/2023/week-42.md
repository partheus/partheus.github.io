description: A precursor to Halloween, and a lot of work on the new website.

> Week of 16 October 2023 - 22 October 2023

Starting to do weeknotes, finally. Making a habit of it, I hope.

## Highlights:

- Did a lot of work on the [new website](/colophon/). It's getting there, surely and magically.
- I went to a pumpkin patch with friends and distantly fought a creature in a corn maze!
- Started reading Upgrade by Blake Crouch. It's a sequel to Recursion, which I read earlier this life. I'm enjoying it so far.
- I need to make custom URL styles, and custom image stuff. Fun!
- I'm going to try to do a lot of work on the website these coming nights.
