- Another normal week; I could get used to this
- I've been getting so many side quests handed to me lately. I'm not complaining because I can have so much more fun; I _have_ been having so much more fun.
- Made a little bracelet thing at a work hangout
- I was re-introduced to coin-operated arcades recently and I've been enjoying them a lot
- Site layout is still of a mercurial mind. It happens
- I'm reading some Jason Bourne **again** FINALLY: [/reading/](/reading/)
