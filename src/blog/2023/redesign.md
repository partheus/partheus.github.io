I have found myself looking at this site on various devices - even a crystal ball - and I have decided that it needs a little more tweaking.

For example, the top navigation is basically a bunch of links without any separation of the nav itself. Interesting, isn't it?

I think the fonts are looking great, they don't take up many resources and I can load the site easily on a decent Internet connection.

Here's the kicker:
- I need to redo the main nav
- I need to redo the footer, maybe clean it up
- Should there be more sections with clear demarcation?
- I need a better layout for my books page. Users don't even know about these things till they have navigated inward

> Hmm
