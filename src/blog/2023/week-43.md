- I was supposed to use my to dress up as Inspector Gadget for a Halloween party
- I ended up dressing up as the Hash Slinging Slasher from Spongebob instead
- Funny thing is, I had a trenchcoat and a spatula for both costumes. The party was a blast!
- I'm getting back into the [reading spirit](/reading) hard; a bunch of my favorite authors are releasing thrillers for the winter
- Things are afoot! Exciting
