Earlier this fall, I was at a movie night with friends, we were watching the animated film [Redline](https://myanimelist.net/anime/6675/Redline). It's amazing.

It was also the night I had procured, for the first time, a few packets of Takis in the brand new flavor. The [Dragon Sweet Chili](https://takis.ca/products/spicy-tortilla-chips/takis-dragon-sweet-chili/280-g). It isn't half bad, and I found it rather tasty. Goes really well with some soda.

I ended up doing a cheeky little dance later on the back patio of my friend's house (I found out later she had been housesitting and it was, in fact, _her friend's house_). 

This dance style is a part of the "shuffling" subgroup, and this specific move is called [the Running Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_shuffle). I like doing it whenever there is a lull in the universal din, or on a case-by-case basis.

I'm glad the person videoing me going just the lower half of my body, which is the most technically relevant part of the dance.

It's a bit dark due to the time of night, but here's the video (ignore the trailcam at the end):
