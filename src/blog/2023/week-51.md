- Watched a bunch of movies this week!
- Johnny Cage's new movie is pretty Christmas-y and fun
- More Jason Bourne books! This new series by Brian Freeman is quite exciting; I'm on the third book now
- Christmas is coming up + I'm excited to sleep in
- Bouldering is going well, I'm getting stronger and stronger, slowly and gently
