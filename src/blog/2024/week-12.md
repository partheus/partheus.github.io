- Tokyo Ghoul done! [Woo](/manga)
- Shrek: The Musical adapted by the ████ ████ High School was absolutely delightful, 2 and a half hours of pure joy
- I'm not sure if I'm ready for the next week, but I'm excited for it. Eventually everything will turn to dust
- My hand has almost fully healed; hopefully I can start climbing again soon
- Reading much non-fiction lately, and I'm enjoying it
