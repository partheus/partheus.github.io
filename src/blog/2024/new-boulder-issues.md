I've missed climbing immensely. The injury from the blades was a setback that could have lasted longer, but it hasn't, and I'm kinda back at the gym. The thing is, because of over a month of not colimbing and the peculaiar recovery schedule from
the injury, I've lost a lot of strength. I'm not as strong as I was before, and when usually I would work on v4 and v5 problems, I had trouble projecting even v3s. It isn't that frustrating because it's a perfectly normal, comprehensible outcome. It's just life.

Most things are like that, you know. Not up to me.

Anyway, look at this new One Piece themed wallpaper I made. It's a Wanted: Alive and in good health poster for myself. I'm worth 9,000,000,000 berries.
