Here's a quick update on the music site I'm working on. I've been learning Vue.js and it's been a lot of fun.

> Staging site link: [Music site](https://marzipant.netlify.app/)

> UPDATE: Live site link: [Music site](https://music.parth.ninja/)

One of the main things is a persistent audio player at the bottom of the page, no matter what the page is being routed to.

The design was secondary for this site, but I'm making steady progress on both the style and functionality of the project.
