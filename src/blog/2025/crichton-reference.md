description: A small tribute to the author?
---
The newest installment in the Jurassic World universe is built on top of another script by David Koepp. Koepp has written some interesting books too, but that's beside the point.

Within the first 8 minutes, we see 2 of the main characters driving in a black car, and a school bus passes behind the vehicle. We can see the name of the school on the yellow bus! It's Crichton Middle School!

Thank you for reading.
